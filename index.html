        <h1>THE STRAY PROBLEMS IN THE PHILIPPINES</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="new-section">
        <div class="info-00">
          <p> According to a survey conducted by the Philippines Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), there were around 12 million stray dogs and cats in the country in 2019.
            These animals are often found wandering the streets, searching for food and shelter.
            Unfortunately, many of them are malnourished, sick, and injured.</p>
         <p>the issue of stray animals in the Philippines is a complex one that requires a multi-faceted approach. It is important to raise awareness
            about the plight of these animals and to promote responsible pet ownership. It is also important to support organizations that are
             working to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome stray animals. By working together, we can help to create a better future for these animals 
             and for our communities.</p>
