        <h1>THE STRAY PROBLEMS IN THE PHILIPPINES</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="new-section">
        <div class="info-00">
          <p> According to a survey conducted by the Philippines Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), there were around 12 million stray dogs and cats in the country in 2019.
            These animals are often found wandering the streets, searching for food and shelter.
            Unfortunately, many of them are malnourished, sick, and injured.</p>
         <p>the issue of stray animals in the Philippines is a complex one that requires a multi-faceted approach. It is important to raise awareness
            about the plight of these animals and to promote responsible pet ownership. It is also important to support organizations that are
             working to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome stray animals. By working together, we can help to create a better future for these animals 
             and for our communities.</p>

            <div class="lower-title"><h1>DONATE</h1></div>
            <div class="lower-text-001"><p>By donating, you can help many stray animals and provide them with the necessary medical
              care, vaccinations, food, and bedding material they need to survive. You can also help control the population of stray animals by supporting spaying and neutering programs.</p><br>
              <p>Additionally, you can educate yourself and others on responsible feeding of stray animals, which involves feeding them the right amount of food, out of sight from high traffic areas, and not taming them.
                Your kindness and compassion can make a difference in the lives of these animals.</p>

            <div class="lower-text-001"><p>By adopting, you can help many stray animals and provide them with a loving home. Adopting a pet is a great way to give an animal a second chance at life and provide them with the care and attention they need.</p><br>
              <p>Additionally, adopting a pet can help reduce the number of animals in shelters and on the streets. If youâ€™re interested in adopting a stray animal, you can check out the Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS). They offer adoption services for rescued animals that are ready to find their forever homes.</p>
